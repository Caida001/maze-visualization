# maze-visualization

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**A* Search**: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than other Algorithms

**Breath-first Search**: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

**Depth-first Search**: an inefficient algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
